# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Random JDR is a web-based Dungeons & Dragons character generator that allows users to create random NPCs (Non-Player Characters) with AI-generated attributes. The application consists of an Angular frontend and a FastAPI backend that integrates with Mistral AI to generate creative character descriptions, quests, and loot. The system supports multiple races and languages, includes OAuth authentication, and is containerized for deployment with Kubernetes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game master, I want to generate random D&D characters by selecting race and language preferences, so that I can quickly create NPCs for my campaigns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a form with race and language selection options
2. WHEN a user selects a race from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL accept dwarf, elf, halfling, human, gnome, or half-orc as valid options
3. WHEN a user selects a language from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL accept French or English as valid options
4. WHEN a user clicks the generate button THEN the system SHALL call the backend API with the selected parameters
5. WHEN the API receives valid parameters THEN the system SHALL return a complete character with all required attributes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game master, I want the generated characters to include comprehensive details, so that I can immediately use them in my campaigns without additional preparation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a character is generated THEN the system SHALL include the character's race, full name, and gender
2. WHEN a character is generated THEN the system SHALL include a creative physical description
3. WHEN a character is generated THEN the system SHALL include the character's attitude toward players
4. WHEN a character is generated THEN the system SHALL include a list of loot items with names and descriptions
5. WHEN a character is generated THEN the system SHALL include a quest that the character can offer to players
6. WHEN the selected language is French THEN the system SHALL generate all text content in French
7. WHEN the selected language is English THEN the system SHALL generate all text content in English

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with the application, so that I can access personalized features and maintain session state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL display a login button
2. WHEN a user clicks the login button THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth authentication flow
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display the user's name and a logout button
4. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL clear the authentication session
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be containerized and deployable, so that I can easily deploy and scale the application in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the backend THEN the system SHALL run in a Docker container with all dependencies
2. WHEN deploying the frontend THEN the system SHALL run in a Docker container with nginx serving static files
3. WHEN deploying to Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL use Helm charts for configuration management
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include PostgreSQL database with proper connection configuration
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for liveness and readiness probes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to have proper monitoring and error handling, so that I can ensure system reliability and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN the system SHALL provide a database connectivity check endpoint
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error status and log the error
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL log relevant information for debugging
4. WHEN CORS requests are made from the frontend THEN the system SHALL allow requests from localhost:4200
5. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to have a clean architecture with separation of concerns, so that the codebase is maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the backend THEN the system SHALL separate configuration, models, and API logic into different modules
2. WHEN examining the frontend THEN the system SHALL use Angular components, services, and models with clear separation
3. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated service layer
4. WHEN handling forms THEN the system SHALL use reactive forms with proper validation
5. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL use reusable components with proper input/output binding
